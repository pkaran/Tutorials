    <!--font-style
    If you want to create italic text, you can use the font-style property. There are three values this property can take: normal, italic, oblique

    Italic fonts were traditionally stylized versions of the font based on calligraphy, whereas an oblique version would take the normal version and put
    it on an angle. It is not unusual for the browser to fail to find an italic version of a typeface, in which case it will use an algorithm to place
    the normal version of the type on a slant, which means that a lot of italic text online is actually oblique.
    -->
    <p>Normal font</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Normal font in italics</p>
    <p style="font-style: oblique;">Normal font in oblique</p>

    <!-- A few other properties -->

    <p style="text-transform: uppercase;">makes lower case appear upper case</p>
    <p style="text-transform: capitalize;">this makes first letter of each word capitalied</p>

        Google was founded in 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, in California. Together, they
        own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google
        as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its new
        headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests
        as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google, Alphabet's leading subsidiary, will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet
        interests. Upon completion of the restructure, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.

    This indicates that every line in a paragraph, except the last line, should be set to take up the full width of the containing box.

    Justified text looks at the words on each individual line and creates an equal gap between those words. It can look odd if you end up with large
    gaps between some words and smaller gaps between others. This often happens when your lines are not very wide or when your text contains long words.
