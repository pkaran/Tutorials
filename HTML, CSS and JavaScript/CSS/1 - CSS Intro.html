	<!-- <link> element to indicate where the CSS fle is located 
	
	The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to fnd the CSS fle used to style the page. It is an empty element 
	(meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it lives inside the <head> element. It should use three attributes:
	
	href: This specifes the path to the CSS fle (which is often placed in a folder called css or styles).
	type: This attribute specifes the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.
	rel: This specifes the relationship between the HTML page and the fle it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS fle
	
	An HTML page can use more than one CSS style sheet. To do this it could have a <link> element for every CSS fle it uses. For example, some authors 
	use one CSS fle to control the presentation (such as fonts and colors) and a second to control the layout.
	-->
	<link href="1 - CSS Intro.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
	
	<!--
	You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element, which usually sits inside the <head> element of the page.
	The <style> element should use the type attribute to indicate that the styles are specifed in CSS. The value should be text/ css.
	-->
	
	<style type="text/css">
		h4 {
		color:orange; }
