<!--- Strong
The use of the <strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might
be said with strong emphasis. By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong> element in bold.-->
<strong>Strong means strong emphasis</strong>

<!--Emphasis
The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show
the contents of an <em> element in italic.-->
<p>I <em>think</em> Ivy was the first.</p>
<p>I think <em>Ivy</em> was the first.</p>
<p>I think Ivy was the <em>first</em>.</p>

<!--Quotations : <blockquote> and <q>
Both elements may use the cite attribute to indicate where the quote is from. Its value should be a URL that will have more information about the source of
the quotation.
-->
<blockquote cite="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">
<p>
The blockquote element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Browsers tend to indent the contents 
of the blockquote element, however you should not use this element just to indent a piece of text - rather you should achieve this effect using CSS.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The q element is used for <q>shorter quotes</q> that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the q element, however 
Internet Explorer does not - therefore many people avoid using the q element.</p>

<!--Changes to cotent <ins> <del> and <s>
The <ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the <del> element can show text that has been deleted from it.
The content of a <ins> element is usually underlined, while the content of a <del> element usually has a line through it.
The <s> element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted). Visually the content of an <s> element will 
usually be displayed with a line through the center.
