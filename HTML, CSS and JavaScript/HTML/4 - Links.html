<!--link text is written between tags. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.
When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an absolute URL.
ignore id attribute for now-->
<a href="https://www.google.com/" id="top">Google (opens in same tab)</a>

<!--When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL

If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just the name of the fle.

If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you can use a slightly more complex syntax to indicate where the page is in relation to 
the current page.

<!--To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specifed email address, you use the <a> element. 
However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.

an email link looks just like any other link but, when it is clicked on, the user's email program will open a new email message and address it to the person
specifed in the link.
