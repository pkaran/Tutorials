<!--Onenote : Images 

img is an empty element (i.e. with no empty tags). Following are various attributes of an img element: 

src = URL to image. URL can be relative or absolute

alt = This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
The text used in the alt attribute is often referred to as alt text. It should give an accurate description of the image content
so it can be understood by screen reader software (used by people with visual impairments) and search engines.

title = provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over
        the image.

height = This specifes the height of the image in pixels

width = This specifes the width of the image in pixels.

NOTE : aling is depracated with HTML5 ! use CSS to aling images instead !!
aling = set alingment of image to left

Images often take longer to load than the HTML code that makes up the rest of the page. It is, therefore, a good idea to specify the size of the image
so that the browser can render the rest of the text on the page while leaving the right amount of space for the image that is still loading.
The size of images is increasingly being specifed using CSS rather than HTML

Images are not block elements i.e. they do not implicitly appear on a new line like <p> and <h1> do
-->
Hover the mouse over the picture to see title of picture ! <br />

<!--figure and figcaptions

Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new <figure> element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.
You can have more than one image inside the <figure> element as long as they all share the same caption.

The <figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image. Before these elements were
created there was no way to associate an <img> element with its caption. Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements simply ignore the new elements
and display the content of them.

A moon is a satellite of earth.

<!-- NOTE : new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images. Align attribute(which lets set allingment of images) has been depracated in HTML5 !! -->

A moon is a satellite of earth. 
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg" title="Moon from telescope" alt="moon" height=100 width=100 align="left"/>
It looks great at night ! The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. 
It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet
 that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.
