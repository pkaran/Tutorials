	<!-- Attributes of Video element:
	
	poster - specify an image to show while the video is downloading or until the user tells the video to play
	controls -  When used, this attribute indicates that the browser should supply its own controls for playback
	loop -  When used, this attribute indicates that the video should start playing again once it has ended.
	autoplay - When used, this attribute specifes that the fle should play automatically.
	
	preload : This attribute tells the browser what to do when the page loads. It can have one of three values:
	none - 	The browser should not load the video until the user presses play.
	auto -  The browser should download the video when the page loads. 	
	metadata - The browser should just collect information such as the size, first frame, track list, and duration.

	<h2>Video with multiple sources</h2>
	
	<!-- 
	To specify the location of the fle to be played, you can use the <source> element inside the <video> element. (This should replace the src attribute 
	on the opening <video> tag.) You can also use multiple <source> elements to specify that the video is available in different formats.
	
	type : You should use this attribute to tell the browser what format the video is. Otherwise, it will download some of the video to see if it can 
	play the fle (which will take time and bandwidth).
	
	codecs : The codec that was used to encode the video is supplied within the type attribute. Note the use of single quotes, as well as double 
	quotes in the type attribute, when it is supplied.

	<!--
	HTML5 introduced the <audio> element to include audio fles in your pages. As with HTML5 video, browsers expect different formats for the audio.
	
	The <audio> element has a number of attributes which allow you to control audio playback:
	
	controls: This attribute indicates whether the player should display controls. If you do not use this attribute, no controls will be shown by default. 
	You can also specify your own controls using JavaScript.
	
	preload : This attribute indicates what the browser should do if the player is not set to autoplay. It can have the following values :
		none - 	The browser should not load the video until the user presses play.
		auto -  The browser should download the video when the page loads. 	
		metadata - The browser should just collect information such as the size, first frame, track list, and duration.
