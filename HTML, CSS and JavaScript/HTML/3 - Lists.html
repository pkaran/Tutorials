<!--HTML supports 3 types of lists:
● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identifed by a section
number.
● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
● Defnition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
defnitions for each of those terms.-->

<!--Ordered lists
Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
Browsers indent lists by default. Sometimes you may see a type attribute used with the <ol> element to specify the type of
numbering (numbers, letters, roman numerals and so on). It is better to use the CSS liststyle-type property covered on pages 333-335.

type="A" - capital letters
type="a" - lower case letters
type="i" - small Roman numerals
-->
<h1>Ordered List</h1>
<ol type="A">
	<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
	<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20 minutes until tender</li>
	<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
	<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
	<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
</ol>

<!--Unordered lists
Browsers indent lists by default. Sometimes you may see a type attribute used with the <ul> element to specify the type of bullet point (circles, squares,
diamonds and so on). It is better to use the CSS list-style type property covered on pages 333-335.-->
<h1>Unordered List</h1>
<ul>
	<li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
	<li>100ml milk</li>
	<li>50g salted butter</li>
	<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
	<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<!--Definition lists
<dt> is used to contain the term being defned (the defnition term)
<dd> This is used to contain the defnition-->
<h1>Definition List</h1>
<dl>
	<dt>Sashimi</dt>
	<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with
	condiments such as shredded daikon radish or
	ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
	
	<dt>Scale</dt>
	<dd>A device used to accurately measure the
	weight of ingredients</dd>
	<dd>A technique by which the scales are removed
	from the skin of a fish</dd>
	
	<dt>Scamorze</dt>
	<dt>Scamorzo</dt>
	<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole
	cow's milk (although it was traditionally made
	from buffalo milk)</dd>
</dl>

<!--Nested lists
Browsers display nested lists indented further than the parent list. In nested unordered lists, the browser will usually change the style of 
the bullet point too.-->
<h1>Nested Lists</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Mousses</li>
	<li>Pastries
	<ul>
		<li>Croissant</li>
		<li>Mille-feuille</li>
		<li>Palmier</li>
		<li>Profiterole</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Tarts</li>
</ul>
