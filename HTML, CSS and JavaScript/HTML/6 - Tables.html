In HTML, table is written row by row.

<!--Tables
The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more <td> elements 
(one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a closing </tr> tag.

Each cell of a table is represented using a <td> element. (The td stands for table data.) At the end of each cell you use a closing </td> tag.

Some browsers automatically draw lines around the table and/or the individual cells. You will learn how to control the borders of tables using CSS
-->

<table>

	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>6</td>
		<td>9</td>
		<td>30</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>12</td>
		<td>325234234234</td>
		<td>18</td>
	</tr>
	
</table>

<br />

<!--Table Headers
The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.)

Even if a cell has no content, you should still use a <td> or <th> element to represent the presence of an empty cell otherwise the table will not render 
correctly. (The frst cell in the frst row of this example shows an empty cell.)

You can use the scope attribute on the <th> element to indicate whether it is a heading for a column or a row. It can take the values: row to indicate a 
heading for a row or col to indicate a heading for a column.

Browsers usually display the content of a <th> element in bold and in the middle of the cell.
-->

<table>

	<!--1st row-->
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th scope="col">Saturday</th>
		<th scope="col">Sunday</th>
	</tr>
	
	<!--2nd row-->
	<tr>
		<th scope="row">Tickets Sold</th>
		<td>300</td>
		<td>900</td>
	</tr>
	
	<!--3rd row-->
	<tr>
		<th scope="row">Total Sales</th>
		<td>$900</td>
		<td>$2700</td>
	</tr>

</table>

<br/>

<!--Table cells spanning multiple rows or columns
The colspan and rowspan attributes are also used at the <td> or <th> level to change the amount of space cells occupy. 
The colspan attribute specifies the amount of columns a cell should span and rowspan attribute specifies the amount of rows a cell should span. 
Using the colspan and rowspan attributes allows you to have one cell span multiple columns or rows.
-->
<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th>9am</th>
		<th>10am</th>
		<th>11am</th>
		<th>12am</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th >Monday</th>
		<td colspan="2" bgcolor="#00CCFF">Geography</td>
		<td bgcolor="#00CCFF">Math</td>
		<td bgcolor="#00CCFF">Art</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Tuesday</th>
		<td colspan="3" rowspan=2 bgcolor="#00CCFF">Gym</td>
		<td bgcolor="#00CCFF">Home</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<th>Wednesday</th>
	</tr>
</table>

<!-- Long tables
There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows (which can contain different content).

<thead> The headings of the table should sit inside the <thead> element.

<tbody> The body should sit inside the <tbody> element.

<tfoot> The footer belongs inside the <tfoot> element.

By default, browsers rarely treat the content of these elements any differently than other elements however designers often use CSS styles to
change their appearance.

Part of the reason for having separate <thead> and <tfoot> elements is so that, if you have a table that is taller than the screen (or, if printed, longer 
than one page) then the browser can keep the header and footer visible whilst the contents of the table scroll. This is intended to make it easier for users
to see which column the data is in (however this functionality is not implemented by default in any current browser)

<!--  !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Old code : border & background !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The border attribute was used on both the <table> and <td> elements to indicate the width of the border in pixels.

The bgcolor attribute was used to indicate background colors of either the entire table or individual table cells. The value is usually 
a hex code (which we discuss on pages 249-252).

This example uses the HTML border and bgcolor attributes. No CSS attributes were utilized in this example.

When building a new website you should use CSS to control the appearance of the table rather than these attributes. 
They are only covered here because you may come across them if you look at the code of older websites.
