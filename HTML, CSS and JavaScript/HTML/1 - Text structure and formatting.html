<!--Headings
HTML has six "levels" of headings:
<h1> is used for main headings, <h2> is used for subheadings
If there are further sections under the subheadings then the <h3> element is used, and so on...
Each heading is shown on as a paragraph (i.e. on a new line with some space above and below it)-->
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>

<!--Paragraph-->
<p>By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs</p>
<p>A  paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The start of a paragraph 
is indicated by a new line</p>

<!--Text Formatting-->
<p>
<b>This is how we make words appear in bold</b>. <i>This is how we make words appear in italics.</i>
2<sup>-1</sup>. H<sub>2</sub>O. <!--think of up in sup as upper and ub in sub as below-->
</p>

<!--White space collapsing
When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes 
across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.
Each of the 3 lies below are shown in the same way.-->
<p>The moon is drifting away from Earth.</p>
<p>The moon 		is drifting away from Earth.</p>
<p>The moon is drifting away from


Earth.</p>

<!--Line breaks and horizontal rules-->
<p>The Earth<br />gets one hundred tons heavier every day<br />due to falling space dust.</p>

<p>Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jupiter is bigger than all the other planets combined.</p>

<!-- Preformatted Text

A web browser interprets your HTML code as being one long line. Preformatted text <pre> is a way to include text in your web page and have it look 
the way you want it to without using HTML tags. When using the <pre> tag, you don't have to put in <p></p> and <br /> tags to tell the browser where 
to put line breaks because the browser displays the text exactly the way you have typed it. Preformatted text works great for poems, computer code and 
other pieces of text that have multiple line breaks.

<!-- Special Characters

 In order for special characters like @, &, <, >, and © to show up on your web page, you need to use a special set of codes called character codes, 
 which you insert into your HTML code so that your browser will display as the corresponding symbols or characters you want.
 
 Some special characters can be identified by a name (&copy; , for example, creates the copyright symbol), others are identified by a number (&#153;
 is for the trademark symbol Â™). Notice that whether you use the word or the number to identify the special character, the HTML always starts with an 
 ampersand (&) and ends with a semi-colon (;).
