	<!--
	Information is sent from browser to server in the form of name/value pair where name is the name of the form control and value is the input value by user

	Form controls live inside the form element. forms may not be nested inside one another, and it is important that they do not overlap.
	
	Attributes of form element:
	
	action : Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in 
	the form when it is submitted.
	
	method : Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
	
		With the get method, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specifed in the action attribute. The get method is ideal for:
		● short forms (such as search boxes)
		● when you are just retrieving data from the web server (not sending information that should be added to or deleted from a database)
		
		With the post method the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should use the post method if your form:
		● allows users to upload a fle
		● is very long
		● contains sensitive data (e.g. passwords)
		● adds information to, or deletes information from, a database
		
		If the method attribute is not used, the form data will be sent using the get method.
		
	id : We look at the id attribute on page 183, but the value is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the page 
	(and is often used by scripts — such as those that check you have entered information into felds that require values).
	
	!!!!!! NOTE : each form control should have its own <label> element as this makes the form accessible to vision-impaired users
			take a look at Labelling Form Controls section below
			
			Good idea to have only 1 button per <form> </form>
	-->

	<form action="info.txt" method="post">
	
		<p>
			<!--
			The <input> element is used to create several different form controls. 
			
			Following are different attributes of input:
			
			type : The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating
			type can be any one of the following: 
			button|checkbox|color|date|time|datetime| datetime-local|email|file|hidden|image|month|number| password|radio|range|reset|search|submit|tel|text|url|week
			
			name : When users enter information into a form, the server needs to know which form control each piece of data was entered into. 
			(For example, in a login form, the server needs to know what has been entered as the username and what has been given as the password.) 
			Therefore, each form control requires a name attribute. 
			The value of this attribute identifes the form control and is sent along with the information they enter to the server.
			
			maxlength : You can use the maxlength attribute to limit the number of characters a user may enter into the text feld. Its value is the number of
			characters they may enter. For example, if you were asking for a year, the maxlength attribute could have a value of 4.		
			
			size : (Use CSS instead of using size) The size attribute should not be used on new forms. It was used in older forms to indicate the width of the
			text input (measured by the number of characters that would be seen)
			-->

			<label>
				Single Line Text Field:
				<input type="text" name="username" size = "10" maxlength="8"/>	<!--use CSS instead of size; value of name attribute along with input is sent to server-->
			</label>
		</p>

		<p>
			<label for="passF">Password:</label>
			<input id="passF" type="password" name="password" size = "20" maxlength="16"> <!--use CSS instead of size; value of name attribute along with pass is sent to server-->
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Text Area:
		</p>
		
		<!-- Any text that appears between the opening <textarea> and closing </textarea> tags will appear in the text box when the page loads.
		Some sites use JavaScript to clear this information when the user clicks in the text area-->
		<textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="4">Enter your comments...</textarea>  <!--use CSS instead of cols and rows-->
	
		<p>
			Radio button:
			
			<!-- When a question provides users with options for answers in the form of radio buttons, the value of the name attribute should be the same 
			for all of the radio buttons used to answer that question.
			
			The name attribute is sent to the server with the value of the option the user selects
			
			Please note: Once a radio button has been selected it cannot be deselected. The user can only select a different option. 
			If you are only allowing the user one option and want them to be able to deselect it (for example if they are indicating they agree to 
			terms and conditions), you should use a checkbox instead.-->
			
			<br />
			<input type="radio" name="genre" value="rock" checked="checked" /> Rock  <!--use labels -->
			<input type="radio" name="genre" value="pop" /> Pop
			<input type="radio" name="genre" value="jazz" /> Jazz			
		</p>
	
		<p>Checkbox:
		
			<br />
			
			<!-- The name attribute is sent to the server with the value of the option(s) the user selects. 
			The value attribute indicates the value sent to the server if this checkbox is checked.
			-->
			
			<input type="checkbox" name="service" value="itunes" checked="checked" /> iTunes
			<input type="checkbox" name="service" value="lastfm" /> Last.fm
			<input type="checkbox" name="service" value="spotify" checked="checked"/> Spotify
		</p>
	
		<p>Dropdown:
		
		<br />
		
		<!--A drop down list box (also known as a select box) allows users to select one option from a drop down list. The <select> element is used to create 
		a drop down list box. It contains two or more <option> elements
		
		value attribute : indicate the value that is sent to the server along with the name of the control if this option is selected
		
		selected : The selected attribute can be used to indicate the option that should be selected when the page loads. The value of this attribute 
		should be selected. If this attribute is not used, the frst option will be shown when the page loads. If the user does not select an option, then 
		the frst item will be sent to the server as the value for this control.
		-->
		
		<select name="devices">
			<option value="ipod">iPod</option>
			<option value="radio">Radio</option>
			<option value="computer" selected="selected">Computer</option>
		</select>
		
		</p>
	
		<p>Multiselect</p>
		
		<!--
		size : You can turn a drop down select box into a box that shows more than one option by adding the size attribute. Its value should be the number 
		of options you want to show at once. Unfortunately, the way that browsers have implemented this attribute is not perfect, and it should be tested 
		throroughly if used (in particular in Firefox and Safari on a Mac).
		
		multiple : You can allow users to select multiple options from this list by adding the multiple attribute with a value of multiple.
		
		It is a good idea to tell users if they can select more than one option at a time. It is also helpful to indicate that on a PC they should hold down 
		the control key while selecting multiple options and on a Mac they should use the command key while selecting options.
		-->
		<select name="instruments" size="3" multiple="multiple">
			<option value="guitar" selected="selected"> Guitar</option>
			<option value="drums">Drums</option>
			<option value="keyboard">Keyboard</option>
			<option value="bass" selected="selected">Bass</option>
		</select>
		
		<p>File input box and Submit Button</p>
		
		<!--
		When you are allowing users to upload fles, the method attribute on the <form> element must have a value of post. (You cannot send fles using the HTTP get method.)
		
		When a user clicks on the browse button, the presentation of the window that allows them to browse for the fle they want to upload will match the 
		windows of the user's operating system. You cannot control the appearance of these windows.
		
		Different browsers will show submit buttons in different ways and tend to ft the visual presentation of the browser. If you want to control the 
		appearance of a submit button, you can either use CSS (as you will learn on page 343), or you can use an image for the button.
		-->
		
		<input type="file" name="user-song-file" /><br />
		<input type="submit" name="uploadButton" value="Upload" />  <!-- The submit button is used to send a form to the server, value is used to set text on button, name attribute is optional -->
	
		<p>Image button</p>
		
		<!--If you want to use an image for the submit button, you can give the type attribute a value of image. The src, width, height, and alt attributes 
		work just like they do when used with the <img> element-->
		
		<input type="text" name="email" />
		<input type="image" src="Images/subscribe.png" width="100" height="17" alt="Subscribe" />
	
		<p>Button & Hidden Controls</p>
		
		<!--The <button> element was introduced to allow users more control over how their buttons appear, and to allow other elements to appear inside the button.
			This means that you can combine text and images between the opening <button> tag and closing </button> tag.
			
			type="hidden"
			This example also shows a hidden form control. These form controls are not shown on the page (although you can see them if you use the View 
			Source option in the browser). They allow web page authors to add values to forms that users cannot see. For example, a web page author might 
			use a hidden feld to indicate which page the user was on when they submitted a form.
		-->
		
		<button><img src="Images/add.png" alt="add" width="10" height="10" /> Add </button>

		<p>
			Check out the hidden input in source code, it is not visible on page !
			<input type="hidden" name="bookmark" value="lyrics" />
		</p>

		
		<p>Labelling Form Controls</p>
		
		<!--
		each form control should have its own <label> element as this makes the form accessible to vision-impaired users.
		
		The <label> element can be used in two ways. It can:
		
		1. Wrap around both the text description and the form input (as shown on the frst line of the example).
		2. Be kept separate from the form control and use the for attribute to indicate which form control it is a label for (as shown with the radio buttons).
		
		<label> is Used to attach information to controls. Each label element is associated with exactly one form control. The label element may
		contain the form control, or it may use the for attribute to identify the control by its id value.
		
		When a <label> element is used with a checkbox or radio button, users can click on either the form control or the label to select. The expanded 
		clickable area makes the form easier to use. The position of the label is very important. If users do not know where to enter information or what 
		information to enter, they are less likely to use the form correctly.
		-->
		
		<label>Age: <input type="text" name="age" /></label>
		
		<br />
		
		Gender:

		<input id="female" type="radio" name="gender" value="f">
		<label for="female">Female</label>		<!--The for attribute states which form control the label belongs to-->
		<input id="male" type="radio" name="gender" value="m">
		<label for="male">Male</label>
		
		<p>Grouping Form Elements</p>
		
		<!--You can group related form controls together inside the <fieldset> element. This is particularly helpful for longer forms.
		Most browsers will show the fieldset with a line around the edge to show how they are related. The appearance of these lines can be adjusted using CSS.
		
		The <legend> element can come directly after the opening <fieldset> tag and contains a caption which helps identify the purpose of that group of 
		form controls.
		-->
		
		<fieldset>
			<legend>Contact details</legend>
			
			<label>Email:<br /><input type="text" name="email" /></label>
			<br />
			<label>Mobile:<br /><input type="text" name="mobile" /></label>
			<br />
			<label>Telephone:<br /><input type="text" name="telephone" /></label>
		</fieldset>
		
		<p>Date Inpute</p>
		
		<!-- HTML5 introduces new form controls (such as date input) to standardize the way that some information is gathered. Older browsers that 
		do not recognize these inputs will just treat them as a single line text box.
		-->
		
		<label>Departure date: <input type="date" name="depart" /> </label>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
		
		<p>Email and URL input</p>
		
		<!-- email input form control will do basic email validation i.e. check if email has @ and some text before and after it.
		 Some smart phones also optimize their keyboard to display the keys you are most likely to need when entering an email address (such as the @ symbol)
		Older browsers that do not recognize these inputs will just treat them as a single line text box.
		--> 
		
		<label>Enter email address : <input type="email" name="email" /></label>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit Email" />
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		<label>Enter a URL : <input type="url" name="url" /></label>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit URL" />
		
		<p>Search</p>
		
		<!--
		Older browsers might igonre search input type and treat it is a simple text box. placeholder attribute might also be ignored by older browsers
		-->
		
		<input type="search" name="search" placeholder="Enter keyword to search..."/>
		<input type="submit" value="Search" />
