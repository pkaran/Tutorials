Technically speaking, sequence assignment actually supports any iterable object on the
right, not just any sequence. This is a more general category that includes collections
both physical (e.g., lists) and virtual (e.g., a file’s lines), which was defined briefly in       : line
Chapter 4 and has popped up in passing ever since. We’ll firm up this term when we
explore iterables in Chapter 14 and Chapter 20.
