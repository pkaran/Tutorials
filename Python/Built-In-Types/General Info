Sequences allow you to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion.
There are three kinds of sequences in Python: strings, lists and tuples. Dictionaries and sets are containers for sequential data.

iteration protocol in Python : Any object with
a __next__ method to advance to a next result, which raises StopIteration at the end
of the series of results, is considered an iterator in Python. Any such object may also
be stepped through with a for loop or other iteration tool, because all iteration tools
normally work internally by calling __next__ on each iteration and catching the StopIteration exception to determine when to exit.
